# Communication-between-Unix-Linux-users

[![N|Solid](https://cldup.com/dTxpPi9lDf.thumb.png)](https://nodesource.com/products/nsolid)

Many years ago, when there was no MSN and not even think about WhatsApp, the administrators of Linux / Unix servers had to have constant communication with the people who were connected to those servers (since they were multi-user systems, users connected through " silly terminals "). The following program is a chat between users of these systems connected to the same server. The base code belongs to the author Francisco Manuel Marquez Garc√≠a, from the book "Unix: Programacion Avanzada".



### Installation

Download the .c files and compile.

```sh
$ gcc -o llamar-a llamar_a_hilos.c -lpthread
$ gcc -o responder-a responder_a_hilos.c -lpthread 
```

### Implementation

```sh
$ ./llamar-a 'USER'
$ ./responder-a 'USER'
```
